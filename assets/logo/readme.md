The base logo is stored in [kson_logo_transparent.svg](kson_logo_transparent.svg). After modifying, the [generate.sh](generate.sh) script can be used to regenerate the svg with the blue (`#90bcfe`) background as well as the 400x400 and 800x800 png equivalents.

This bash script expects `inkscape` to be available on your path.
