## Embedding tests from JSONTestSuite

As discussed in https://seriot.ch/projects/parsing_json.html, striving to be a good JSON parser involves being aware of 
and correctly handling numerous specific data edge cases.

In this folder, we include the contents of [nst/JSONTestSuite](https://github.com/nst/JSONTestSuite).

Latest update is synced from commit [d64aefb](https://github.com/nst/JSONTestSuite/commit/d64aefb55228d9584d3e5b2433f720ea8fd00c82).
